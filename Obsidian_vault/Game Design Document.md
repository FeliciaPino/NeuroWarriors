THis game will be super cool and so fun! Everyone is gonna love it and I'm gonna be a [BIG SHOOT]. (yeah, prolly not, haha)

It's a turn based RPG based around Neuro-sama and her friends and family. The player engages in tactical battles against evil robots.

It's a world that's pretty silly! But not tooo  silly! And the logic of the battles isn't very literal! THey aren't very much canon! just that they fight and they win! but they don't litterally throw bottles and bottles of rum! I think. maybe not!

So, you explore the post-apocalyptic world thats swarming with evil robots that swear allegiance to "The Empress", whoever that is! and you play and you start with just neuro sama, but as you progress you find more of her friends and family! assemble a team with up to 3 of all N Neuroverse characters I have added in the game!

Each character has many individual abilities, and you can choose up to 3 abilities of those all those abilities to take into battle, and you take up to 3 characters to have in the team to take to battle! and then you can make any character do any action on any entity on the battlefield! Ideally you would heal your allies and attack your enemies, but some actions could get more ambiguous! 

Everytime you defeat some enemiy you gather some tungesten cubes, and also when you win battles you gain experience and level up! And then when you level up enough you can unlock some upgrades in the skill tree! Which you can purchase with tungesten!

OUtside of battle you can walk around and stuff, and the're the enemies, and if the reach you then you enter the battle, but if they don't reach you then you don't.  and well, you can walk around and go forward in the story, and theres story and some wacky dialogue in the story, and you can do an press [e] to interact (to eenteract) and they say stuff maybe, and ther's probably like puzzles and stuff on the not battle mode! 

Cool areas to explore, such as the forest, the city, and that's all! but there' will be so many more like, the spooky forest, the bug zone, the pirate seas, jungle, lava, virtual world, the moon maybe! And they'll have bosses, all sort of wacky characters these bosses! I have no idea what they will be or what they will be like, but rest assured they'll all be robots! 

oh, and npcs, and probably funny minigames! Like there's like freddy fazbear! hur hurh hur hur hur. 

Oh, I've bitten more than I can chew! I am so terrified! But I can't not make this! or at least try!



So, there's will be many areas so cool to explroe with many rooms. and I want them to have pzuzzles! puzelez. puzlwes

them, on the city area, there's the puzzles with the sliding blocks. llike that mobile game Unblock Me. Classic puzzle. There's like, some self-driving cars that are stuck and covering the way, and Vedal can hack into a terminal of some sort to control them. So you have to.... clear the way!
