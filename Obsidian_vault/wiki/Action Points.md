Action Points, or AP for short, are used in [[Battle]] to do [[Battle Actions]].
Action Points are individual between each character. For example, if Vedal has 0 points, he can't do anything no matter how many points Neuro has. 
At the start of each turn, each character gains a certain amount of AP depending on their AP Regen stat.
AP is kept between turns, and there's no limit to how much you can stuck up, so you could possibly attack 50 times in a single turn! Or however many, really.

AP, however, is not preserved between battles. At the end of the battle they're all gone.
