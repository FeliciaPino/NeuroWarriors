 Here's the stuff I downloaded online:

The delightful CC0 music was made by Pixel-boy at at Sparklin Labs

The sound effects where made by Kronbits

Except for the \"heart\" sound I'm not sure where that came from

Special thanks to my mom for being so great
and to ChatGPT for listening to me ramble for hours about my ideas
and occasionally giving good technical advice."
